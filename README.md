A library to interact with Ethereum blockchains.

For now, the library contains:
1) bindings to the Geth RPC interface (via http)
2) scripts to deploy geth nodes via ssh
3) some ongoing work on building an ASM on top the bytecode that is more easily manipulated programmatically.

Depends on ssh-client (not in OPAM) among other things.
